      <h3>Our problems</h3>
    <div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-16 w3-left ">
        <p>The main problem we had is that we were distracted by our teamates, other teams and mostly, ourselfes. At the start of robotics, during the first month, our team was just messing around and didn't really knew what to do. <br> This wouldn't have happenned if we clearly planned what we wanted to do and how.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that we were disorganized. We passed most of our time searching for items, undoing what we did before. I think this the reason why we were so short on time. During the last month, we were very organized and we did lots of progress very quickly. But it was too late. When we started working seriously, we alwready had wasted 2 months.</p>
        <p>We wasted a lot time cutting metal. We would've saved at least 4 periods if made sure it was a good idea to cut the metal before we did so. <br> We would've realized that since we did not use arduino motors anymore, we didn't need to cut the robot in half.</p>
        <p>We lost a lot of time arguing and fighting another team.</p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-16 w3-left ">
       <p>We are satisfied with our progress. Even thought we were very distracted at first and didn't rly knew what to do and some teamates did not help much, we still managed to keep up and make lots of progess in very short time.</p>
      <p>We are proud of what we achivied. We had more problems. I didn't mention all of them but we had way more problems. Most of them were just small and annoying problems but they could still slow us down a lot or make us waste a entire period trying to fix it. Stuff that should've taken half a period max took us 2 days to finish. And we still managed to finish the project in time. That is why we are proud of what we achivied.</p>
